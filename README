Douglas A-26 'Invader'.
The damn program that overloads your victim with Skype calls, snowing him/her up to the eyes. The basic principle is simple: "A-26" calls the victim, wait for ring tones, then hangs up and repeats, again and again. Because we hang up before the victim gets to a phone, no money will be charged off from your account. The whole process is absolutely free. And you can play around with "hang-after" option and specify time delay before hangup. Hey, and don't forget to turn your microphone off!
